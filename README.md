Ubuntu Wattpad Scope
====================

# What is [wattpad](https://wattpad.com)?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wattpad)
> Wattpad is a writing community in which users are able to post articles, stories, fan fiction, and poems, either through the website or the mobile app. This gives people the chance to have their creative works available to a wider audience. The content includes work by undiscovered writers, published writers, new writers, with all users being given an equal chance to write popular works. Users are able to comment and like stories or join groups associated with the website. Around half of the users are US based; other users come from the UK, Canada, the Philippines, Australia, Russia, United Arab Emirates and other countries.

Inspiration

My friends LOVE wattpad, they also published some of their stories, so this was one of my first choices for a scope.

Big thanks

I'd like to thank first and foremost David Call√©, Benjamin M. Zeller and Ricardo Garcia Silva, but also all the other awesome people, including the developers of the Unity Scopes JS API, who are making scope development mainstream :)
